This was a project where I calibrated with Rambam Health Care Campus. I predicted with around 93% accuracy if diabetics will develop neuropathic pain or not using ML and signal processing.

Here is the abstract of the report I wrote:

Diabetes can lead to neuropathy, a condition causing nerve damage that can result in significant pain.
Leveraging data obtained from Rambam â€“ Health Care Campus, I focused on the correlation between diabetic neuropathic pain and brain activity, employing electroencephalography (EEG).
The study included 180 participants, divided into groups with painful and non-painful diabetic neuropathic pain.
EEG data was collected using 63 electrodes from each participant during a 3-minute period.
I employed a hybrid approach, combining classical methods and machine learning techniques to forecast and distinguish between the two groups.
I explored correlations among power spectral densities of electrode pairs, due to synchronization across different brain regions.
Subsequently, a machine learning algorithm prioritized parameter based on their predictive significance.
Following this, we ran a classification algorithm considering the most crucial parameters to predict painful and non-painful diabetic neuropathic pain, achieving accuracy levels in the 90% range across various frequency ranges.
Notably, in the theta frequency range (4-8 Hz), associated with light sleep, meditation, and cognitive processes like memory and learning, I achieved a prediction accuracy of 93%.
